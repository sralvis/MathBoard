# MathBoard
Whiteboard for math calculations

will implement features of leading software like Mathcad Prime and legacy Mathcad 15

Part I: Architectural Foundations and User Interface PhilosophyThe defining characteristic of Mathcad Prime 10 is its adherence to a "whiteboard" interface philosophy, which fundamentally differentiates it from command-line driven environments. This architecture is designed to merge the documentation of design intent with the execution of calculations, reducing the cognitive load associated with translating engineering theory into executable syntax.1.1 The Document-Centric WorkspaceUnlike script-based tools where code is distinct from output, Mathcad Prime 10 employs a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get (WYSIWYG) interface. The workspace mimics a sheet of engineering graph paper, allowing users to place regions—mathematical expressions, text blocks, images, and plots—arbitrarily on the canvas.1.1.1 Grid-Based Alignment and Region ManagementThe workspace is underpinned by a grid system that facilitates the visual alignment of calculations, crucial for creating professional-grade reports. Mathcad Prime 10 offers toggleable "Standard" and "Fine" grid options, allowing users to align complex systems of equations with precision.3 The "Regions" concept is central to this behavior:Math Regions: These contain executable equations. They interact with the calculation engine and update dynamically.Text Regions: These provide narrative context. A significant enhancement in Prime 10 is the expanded rich-text capability, specifically the inclusion of subscript and superscript formatting within text regions.1 This seemingly minor update addresses a critical documentation need, allowing engineers to denote chemical formulas (e.g., $H_2O$) or variable indices (e.g., $x_{max}$) within the explanatory text, maintaining consistency with the mathematical notation used in calculation regions.Region Interaction: Regions can overlap, which historically caused readability issues. Prime 10 includes tools to "Separate Regions" vertically or horizontally, ensuring that as equations expand during derivation, they do not obscure surrounding content.31.1.2 View States and Page FormattingThe interface supports two primary view modes: Page View, which displays headers, footers, and margins to simulate the final printed document, and Draft View, which presents an infinite canvas for uninterrupted scratchpad calculations. In Prime 10, the header and footer functionality has been enhanced to support "World Date" and "System Date" formats, enabling automated timestamping of reports for revision control.4 This is particularly relevant for quality assurance workflows where the date of calculation execution must be rigorously tracked.1.2 The Ribbon Interface and Functional CategorizationMathcad Prime 10 utilizes a structured ribbon interface, categorizing functionality into logical groupings that mirror the engineering workflow: definition, calculation, analysis, and presentation.Math Tab: This serves as the primary command center, housing operators, symbols, and unit definitions. It provides access to the "Region" controls, allowing users to disable calculation for specific regions or lock them to prevent accidental modification.Input/Output Tab: This tab manages external connectivity. It includes the "Data Import/Export" suite (ReadExcel, WriteExcel) and the "Integration" group for driving parameters in PTC Creo Parametric. Crucially, this tab houses the new "Controls" group in Prime 10, which provides access to the Advanced Scripted Controls (Combo Box, List Box, Slider, etc.).1Functions Tab: This tab exposes the library of over 400 built-in functions, organized by domain (e.g., Differential Equations, Statistics, Signal Processing). The organization facilitates discovery, allowing users to browse available algorithms without referencing external documentation.Matrices/Tables Tab: Dedicated to array manipulation, this tab provides tools for inserting matrices, extracting rows/columns, and performing tensor operations.Plots Tab: This tab controls data visualization, offering access to XY plots, Polar plots, Contour plots, and 3D surface plots, along with their respective formatting options.61.3 The Unit Management EngineThe most potent feature within the Mathcad architecture is its intrinsic unit intelligence. Unlike Excel or standard programming languages where numbers are dimensionless scalars, Mathcad treats units as fundamental properties of variables.Dimensional Consistency: The engine performs real-time dimensional analysis. Attempting to add a length ($m$) to a mass ($kg$) triggers an immediate error, acting as a safeguard against derivation errors.Automated Conversion: The engine handles unit conversion automatically. An engineer can define a force in Newtons and display the result in pounds-force simply by typing "lbf" in the result placeholder.Custom Unit Systems: While Prime 10 supports standard unit systems (SI, USCS, CGS), it also allows for the definition of custom units. This is vital for specialized industries, such as petroleum engineering which may mix oilfield units (barrels, psi) with SI units.Part II: Comprehensive Documentation of Calculation CapabilitiesThe core value of Mathcad Prime 10 lies in its mathematical engine, which integrates numeric computation with symbolic derivation. This section documents the specific capabilities of this engine across various mathematical domains.2.1 The Numeric Calculation EnginePowered by the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), the numeric engine handles floating-point arithmetic with high precision and performance.2.1.1 Algorithm Selection and ControlA major enhancement in Mathcad Prime 10 is the user's ability to explicitly select solving algorithms for specific functions. In previous versions, the software automatically selected a solver. Prime 10 exposes these choices via a right-click context menu for functions such as odesolve, find, minimize, maximize, and minerr.1Optimization Algorithms: Users can now choose between Levenberg-Marquardt, Conjugate Gradient, and Quasi-Newton methods. This is critical for non-linear optimization problems where specific algorithms may struggle to converge depending on the topology of the objective function.Differential Equation Solvers: For ODEs, users can select between fixed-step and adaptive-step solvers (e.g., Adams/BDF for stiff systems, Runge-Kutta for non-stiff systems), providing control over the speed-accuracy trade-off.2.1.2 Multithreading and PerformanceMathcad Prime 10 features an enhanced multithreading architecture. The engine identifies independent calculation blocks within the worksheet and distributes their execution across available processor cores.5 This parallelization significantly reduces calculation time for complex worksheets containing multiple independent analyses, such as Monte Carlo simulations or iterative design loops.2.2 The Symbolic Calculation EngineThe symbolic engine enables analytic manipulation of mathematical expressions. Prime 10 continues the refinement of the new symbolic engine introduced in Prime 6 (replacing the legacy Maple engine).2.2.1 Symbolic Evaluation and ModificationUsing the symbolic evaluation operator (→), users can perform algebraic operations without assigning numerical values.Simplification and Expansion: The engine can simplify complex algebraic fractions, factor polynomials, and expand trigonometric identities.Differentiation and Integration: It computes derivatives and indefinite integrals symbolically.Keyword Expansion: Prime 10 introduces the standard keyword, which allows for Big-O notation in series expansions and explicitly displays the constant of integration in indefinite integrals.4 Additionally, the fully keyword has been expanded to support recursive simplification in more use cases, and the rewrite keyword now supports modifiers like arg, atan2, and fact to force expressions into specific forms.52.3 Differential Equation SolvingMathcad Prime 10 provides a comprehensive suite of tools for solving ordinary and partial differential equations, a cornerstone of engineering analysis.Solve Blocks: The primary mechanism for solving differential equations is the Solve Block. This construct uses natural notation:Guess Values: Initial conditions are defined.Constraints: The differential equations and boundary conditions are written using boolean equality.Solver: The odesolve function is called to generate the solution function.Supported Systems: The solver handles linear and non-linear ODEs, systems of coupled ODEs, and stiff systems.PDE Solvers: For partial differential equations, Mathcad offers pdesolve and numol (Numerical Method of Lines). Numol allows for the discretization of spatial derivatives while leaving the time derivative continuous, effectively converting a PDE into a system of ODEs that can be solved using standard integrators.12.4 Data Analysis and Signal ProcessingWhile not a "Big Data" tool, Mathcad Prime 10 includes a robust library for engineering data analysis.2.4.1 Interpolation and RegressionInterpolation: Functions such as linterp (linear), cspline (cubic spline), lspline, and pspline allow for the creation of continuous functions from discrete datasets.Regression: The linefit function handles linear regression, while genfit provides a powerful Levenberg-Marquardt solver for fitting arbitrary non-linear functions to data.7 Prime 10’s algorithm selection feature is particularly useful here, allowing users to tune the solver for difficult curve-fitting problems.2.4.2 Signal ProcessingThe signal processing library includes Fast Fourier Transforms (fft, cfft, ifft) for frequency domain analysis. It also includes smoothing functions (supsmooth, medsmooth) for noise reduction in experimental data.8 While the Wavelet library is less extensive than in legacy versions, the core spectral analysis tools remain integral to electrical and mechanical vibration workflows.2.5 Advanced Scripted ControlsA pivotal addition to Mathcad Prime 10 is the suite of Advanced Scripted Controls. These controls allow users to embed interactive form elements directly into the worksheet, driven by scripting languages.92.5.1 Control TypesList Box: Facilitates the selection of single or multiple items from a defined list, useful for selecting materials or load cases.Radio Button: Enforces mutually exclusive choices.Checkbox: Toggles binary states (e.g., activating a specific failure mode check).Slider: Allows for continuous, dynamic adjustment of variables within a range, providing immediate visual feedback on calculation results.Text Box: Accepts alphanumeric input that can be parsed and utilized within scripts.Push Button: Triggers specific script execution, useful for resetting forms or initiating data export routines.2.5.2 Scripting IntegrationIn Prime 10, these controls are powered by VBScript and JScript. (Note: Python support was officially added in Prime 11, but Prime 10 relies on these two established scripting languages).2 This capability transforms static worksheets into interactive "Apps," allowing senior engineers to deploy complex calculations to junior staff or clients who interact only with the controls, protecting the underlying mathematical logic.Part III: Competitive Gap Analysis and Missing FeaturesTo fully understand the position of Mathcad Prime 10 in the market, it is necessary to compare it against its primary competitors: MATLAB, Wolfram Mathematica, Python, Maple, and SMath Studio. This analysis highlights specific features and capabilities present in these tools that are absent or limited in Mathcad Prime 10.3.1 Comparison with MATLAB (The MathWorks)MATLAB dominates the field of algorithm development and system simulation. Its "code-first" paradigm contrasts sharply with Mathcad’s "document-first" approach.3.1.1 Block-Diagram System Simulation (Simulink)Competitor Capability: MATLAB is inextricably linked with Simulink, a graphical environment for Model-Based Design. Engineers use Simulink to model dynamic systems (e.g., a suspension system or a control loop) by connecting blocks representing transfer functions, integrators, and physical components.11 It supports time-domain simulation of multi-domain systems (mechanical, electrical, hydraulic) via Simscape.Mathcad Gap: Mathcad Prime 10 possesses no equivalent to Simulink. It cannot perform graphical block-diagram simulation. Dynamic systems must be modeled by manually deriving and writing the governing differential equations. There is no visual representation of the system topology (the "plant model").3.1.2 Application Deployment (App Designer)Competitor Capability: MATLAB’s App Designer allows users to build standalone executable applications (.exe) with sophisticated Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). These apps can be distributed to users who do not have a MATLAB license (via the MATLAB Runtime).11Mathcad Gap: While Prime 10 introduces Scripted Controls, it cannot compile worksheets into standalone executables. The end-user must always have the Mathcad software installed to run the calculation. This limits the distribution of engineering tools to external clients or vendors.3.1.3 Domain-Specific ToolboxesCompetitor Capability: MATLAB offers a vast ecosystem of specialized toolboxes. For example:Phased Array System Toolbox: For designing antenna arrays.Model Predictive Control Toolbox: For advanced control algorithms.Deep Learning Toolbox: For neural network design.Mathcad Gap: Mathcad’s function library is broad but shallow compared to these specialized toolboxes. It lacks built-in, industry-specific libraries for fields like autonomous driving, 5G communications, or bioinformatics. Engineers in these fields must manually implement the necessary algorithms in Mathcad.3.2 Comparison with Wolfram MathematicaMathematica is the leader in symbolic computation and computational knowledge.3.2.1 The Knowledge Engine (Wolfram Alpha Integration)Competitor Capability: Mathematica integrates with the Wolfram Knowledgebase. A user can execute a command like ChemicalData or CityData and retrieve curated, real-time data from the cloud.12Mathcad Gap: Mathcad Prime 10 is an offline tool regarding data. It has no built-in knowledge of physical constants (beyond basic physics), material properties, or geographic data. All such parameters must be manually looked up and defined by the user.3.2.2 Dynamic Interactivity (Manipulate)Competitor Capability: The Manipulate command in Mathematica allows users to wrap any expression or plot in a single command to automatically generate sliders and controllers for all free variables. This provides instant, zero-setup interactivity.Mathcad Gap: While Prime 10 allows for controls, they require manual instantiation, placement, and scripting. There is no "instant" interactivity command that automatically builds a UI for a given equation.3.2.3 Advanced Symbolic LogicCompetitor Capability: Mathematica’s symbolic engine excels at abstract mathematics, including pattern matching, rule-based programming, and operations on abstract algebraic structures (groups, rings).Mathcad Gap: Mathcad’s symbolic engine is optimized for standard engineering calculus. It does not support the high-level abstract logic or functional programming paradigms found in Mathematica.3.3 Comparison with Python (Open Source Ecosystem)Python has emerged as a dominant force in engineering due to its zero cost and massive library ecosystem.3.3.1 Data Handling and Wrangling (Pandas)Competitor Capability: The Pandas library in Python introduces the DataFrame, a powerful structure for manipulating structured data. It supports operations like groupby, merge, pivot, and handling of missing data (NaN) with ease.14Mathcad Gap: Mathcad handles data primarily as matrices. It lacks sophisticated data wrangling tools. There is no native function to "inner join" two tables or to "group by" a categorical variable. Cleaning messy engineering data is significantly more laborious in Mathcad than in Python.3.3.2 Open Source LibrariesCompetitor Capability: Python users have instant access to libraries like CoolProp (for thermodynamic properties), SciPy (for advanced scientific computing), and Scikit-learn (for machine learning) via the pip install command.16Mathcad Gap: Mathcad cannot directly import Python libraries (though Prime 11 improves Python integration, Prime 10 relies on built-in functions). Accessing thermodynamic data for a specific refrigerant, for instance, often requires manual data entry or reliance on specific PTC extension packs.3.3.3 Version Control and CollaborationCompetitor Capability: Python scripts are plain text files. They integrate seamlessly with Git, allowing for rigorous version control, branching, merging, and diffing.Mathcad Gap: Mathcad files (.mcdx) are binary packages (XML-based). They are opaque to Git. Engineers cannot view a textual "diff" to see what equations changed between version 1 and version 2. This hinders collaborative development and code review processes.153.4 Comparison with SMath StudioSMath Studio is a lightweight, free alternative that replicates the Mathcad paper-like interface.3.4.1 Plugin EcosystemCompetitor Capability: SMath Studio features a built-in Plugin Manager. Users can browse and install community-developed extensions directly from the interface, adding features like structural steel databases, unit extensions, or specialized solvers.17Mathcad Gap: Mathcad Prime 10 is a closed ecosystem. Functionality is determined by PTC releases. There is no community plugin store for sharing or installing user-created extensions. Extending Mathcad requires creating DLLs in C++, which is a high barrier for most engineers.3.4.2 PortabilityCompetitor Capability: SMath Studio is extremely lightweight (<10 MB) and offers a Portable version that can run from a USB drive without administrative privileges.17Mathcad Gap: Mathcad Prime 10 is an enterprise-grade application with a significant installation footprint and dependencies (.NET Framework). It requires installation and licensing activation, making it unsuitable for portable or restricted-access environments.Part IV: The Legacy Gap (Mathcad 15 vs. Prime 10)A unique aspect of the Mathcad landscape is the "internal competition" between the current Prime generation and the legacy Mathcad 15. Despite years of development, Prime 10 still lacks certain features present in the legacy version, creating a barrier for long-time users.4.1 Visualization Deficiencies3D Plotting: Mathcad 15 offered extensive customization for 3D plots, including the ability to map color gradients to a fourth variable and to embed titles and legends directly within the plot object. Prime 10’s native 3D plots are less flexible, often requiring the use of the separate Chart Component for advanced formatting, which breaks the seamless workflow.18Interactive Trace: Mathcad 15 allowed users to hover over any point on a 2D plot to see its coordinates dynamically (Trace). Prime 10 lacks this native interactive tracing capability.4.2 Content and Usability GapsE-Books: Mathcad 15 supported "E-Books"—navigable, interactive collections of worksheets that functioned as digital textbooks. Prime 10 does not support this file format, rendering vast libraries of legacy educational content unusable without manual conversion.18Web Controls: Mathcad 15 included HTML-based "Web Controls." These are incompatible with Prime 10. While the new Advanced Controls replace this functionality, there is no automatic migration path; legacy sheets using web controls require manual reconstruction.18Part V: Strategic Integration and Usage Recommendations5.1 When to Select Mathcad Prime 10Mathcad Prime 10 is the optimal tool for the Detailed Design and Verification phases of engineering. Its strength lies in:documentation: When the calculation must be auditable by a third party (e.g., a building inspector or a client).Unit Safety: When dimensional errors pose a significant risk to the project integrity.Derivation: When the engineer needs to work through the "first principles" physics of a problem before moving to simulation.
